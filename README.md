# AgentAutoKit

Reusable multi-agent workflow kit for **npm + TypeScript + Vitest + Vercel** projects, for use with Claude Code. Ships as **both** a repo template and a Claude Code plugin.

The idea: instead of one general assistant doing everything, AgentAutoKit gives you a small **team of specialist agents** — each on the right model tier, each with the narrowest tools it needs — coordinated by an orchestrator and fenced in by guardrail hooks so nothing risky (secrets, deploys, un-tested code) slips through.

## Product at a glance

AgentAutoKit is a drop-in `.claude/` configuration. Once installed into a project, typing `/init-kit <task>` starts a coordinated pipeline: explore → (design) → implement → (debug) → test → review, with two hooks acting as a safety net on every edit and every attempt to finish.

Three moving parts:

| Part | What it is | Where it lives |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Agents** | 8 specialists with scoped tools + model tiers | `agents/` (plugin) · `template/.claude/agents/` |
| **Guardrails** | Two shell hooks that block unsafe edits and un-verified finishes | `hooks/` · `template/.claude/hooks/` |
| **Telemetry & tuning** | Per-model speed/cost + fit scoring that feeds routing back into itself | `scripts/` + `SubagentStop` hook |
| **Status line** | Live view of which agents are running (agent-panel rows + bottom bar) | `scripts/*statusline.sh` + `subagentStatusLine`/`statusLine` |
| **Commands** | `/init-kit` (entry), `/kit-stats` (scorecard), `/kit-tune` (re-allocate) | `commands/` · `template/.claude/commands/` |

---

## How it is delivered

The kit exists in two forms from the same repo. They differ in one important way: **plugins cannot ship permission rules** — Claude Code only reads `agent`/`subagentStatusLine` from a plugin's settings — so the permission `deny`/`allow`/`ask` lists live only in the template's `settings.json`.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph KIT["AgentAutoKit repo"]
    direction LR
    P["Plugin surface<br/>agents · commands · hooks · skills"]
    T["Template surface<br/>template/.claude + CLAUDE.md"]
  end
  P -->|"/plugin install"| PROJ
  T -->|"scripts/init.sh"| PROJ
  subgraph PROJ["Your project/.claude"]
    CMD["/init-kit command"]
    AG["8 specialist agents"]
    HK["Guardrail hooks"]
    ST["settings.json<br/>permission deny/allow/ask"]
  end
  note["Plugins cannot ship permission rules —<br/>only the template carries settings.json"]
  T -.->|"carries"| ST
  P -.->|"cannot ship"| note
  note -.-> ST
```

**Rule of thumb:** use the **template** if you want the permission guardrails (recommended); use the **plugin** if you just want reusable agents/commands/hooks and will add the deny rules yourself.

## The agent team

Eight agents split into three lanes — one coordinator, four read-only advisors, three read-write builders. Model tier is chosen per role: `haiku` for cheap fan-out exploration, `sonnet` for routine building, `opus` for judgement-heavy work (design, hard bugs, review).

## Deep dive: what each agent does

### `orchestrator` — the coordinator (opus, read-only)
The entry brain. It never edits code itself; its whole job is judgement and routing.

- **Inputs:** the task, plus a quick read of `CLAUDE.md` + `package.json` to load conventions and commands.
- **Decides:** how hard the task is, which specialist to call, and — critically — what to do when a branch fails (re-plan rather than stop).
- **Escalation rule it enforces:** send `implementer` → `deep-debugger` **only** when the same test fails ≥ 2× on one change, or the problem is async/race, complex generics, or subtle state.
- **Feedback loop:** if review comes back "changes requested", route findings back to `implementer`, capped at **2 rounds**; after that, stop and summarize the blocker for the human.
- **Hard limits:** never push/deploy/delete, never bypass the verify gate.

> Note on execution: the orchestration *playbook* is what the `/init-kit` command runs in the main session (which can delegate). `orchestrator.md` documents that playbook.

### `code-scout` — the explorer (haiku, read-only)
Cheap, fast, high fan-out. Runs first so the expensive agents don't burn tokens re-discovering the codebase.

- **Returns:** files that matter (path + one line each), key functions/types and where they live, and anything surprising (dead code, duplicate logic, TODOs).
- **Boundaries:** proposes no changes; refuses to read `.env*`/secrets and says so instead.

### `arch-advisor` — the designer (opus, read-only)
Pulled in only when a task needs a real design decision, so you pay for opus judgement only when it matters.

- **Returns:** 2–3 viable approaches with concrete tradeoffs, one clear recommendation tied to the codebase's existing patterns, and flagged risks (coupling, migration cost, performance, testability).
- **Style:** decision-oriented — always ends with a recommendation, not a menu.

### `implementer` — the default builder (sonnet)
The workhorse. Most tasks live and die here.

- **Method:** read first (or reuse code-scout's map) → make the **smallest** change that fully solves the task → keep `tsc --noEmit` clean and `vitest run` green → match existing style.
- **Self-limiting:** if it hits the same test failure twice, it stops and reports so the orchestrator can escalate — it does not thrash.
- **Boundaries:** won't touch protected files (the hook blocks it anyway), won't push/deploy/delete.

### `deep-debugger` — the specialist (opus)
Called for the bugs `implementer` can't crack: async/race conditions, complex generics, subtle state.

- **Method:** form an explicit root-cause hypothesis *before* touching code → confirm with targeted logging or a minimal failing test → fix the root cause, not the symptom → verify with tsc + vitest → **remove debug scaffolding** before finishing.
- **Output contract:** explains the root cause in one paragraph so the fix is understood, not just applied.

### `test-writer` — the coverage author (sonnet)
Ships alongside every change with new/changed logic.

- **Method:** read the code under test and the diff → write tests for intended behavior, edge cases, and error paths → colocated `*.test.ts` matching conventions → run `vitest run` and confirm green.
- **Integrity rule:** never edits source to make a test pass — if the code looks wrong, it reports rather than papering over it.

### `code-reviewer` — quality gate (opus, read-only, once per PR)
Reviews the accumulated `git diff`, not every edit.

- **Returns:** issues grouped **Critical / Warning / Suggestion**, each with file + line + what to change; says so plainly when the diff is clean.
- **Boundaries:** reports only — the orchestrator routes fixes back to `implementer`.

### `security-auditor` — security gate (opus, read-only, once per PR)
Runs **in parallel** with `code-reviewer` so the two gates don't serialize.

- **Checks:** committed/logged secrets, injection (SQL/command/XSS), unsafe deserialization, missing authz/authn and IDOR, unsafe user-input handling and path traversal, dependency risks introduced by the change.
- **Returns:** findings by severity with concrete remediation; reports only, never edits.

## The workflow, step by step

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["/init-kit &lt;task&gt;"] --> B["orchestrator<br/>read CLAUDE.md + package.json, judge difficulty"]
  B --> C["code-scout<br/>map files, call sites, TODOs"]

  D -->|yes| E["arch-advisor<br/>2-3 approaches + recommendation"]
  D -->|no| F["implementer<br/>smallest change, tsc clean + vitest green"]
  E --> F
  F --> G{"same test fails ≥2×<br/>or async / race / types?"}

  G -->|no| I["test-writer<br/>edge + error cases"]

  J --> K{"changes<br/>requested?"}
  K -->|"yes · max 2 rounds"| F
  K -->|no| L["human opens / merges PR"]
```

The two decision diamonds are where the kit earns its keep: **escalation** (route hard bugs to opus instead of letting sonnet thrash) and the **review loop** (bounded at 2 rounds so it can't spin forever).

```

---

## Guardrails

Two hooks enforce the rules regardless of what any agent decides. They are the reason the kit is safe to run semi-autonomously.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph EVERY["On every Edit / Write / MultiEdit"]
    direction TB
    E1["PreToolUse"] --> PF["protect-files.sh"]
    PF --> PD{"protected path?<br/>.env · *.pem · *.key<br/>secrets/ · CI · migrations"}
    PD -->|yes| BLK["exit 2 — edit blocked"]
    PD -->|no| OK["edit allowed"]
  end
  subgraph FIN["When an agent tries to stop"]
    direction TB
    S1["Stop hook"] --> VF["verify.sh"]
    VF --> VG{"tsc --noEmit &&<br/>vitest run pass?"}
    VG -->|no| RB["block + feed failures back"]
    VG -->|yes| DONE["finish allowed"]
  end
```

- **`protect-files.sh`** (PreToolUse on `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`) — blocks writes to `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets/`, `.github/workflows/`, and `migrations/` (matched whether the path is absolute or root-relative). Exits `2`, and its stderr is fed back to the agent so it knows *why* it was blocked.
- **`verify.sh`** (Stop) — before an agent is allowed to finish, runs `tsc --noEmit` then `vitest run`. On failure it emits a `block` decision with the tail of the output, forcing a fix before completion. Skips gracefully when there is no `package.json`, and guards against infinite Stop-hook loops.

Complementing the hooks, the template's `settings.json` sets **permission** policy:

- `deny` — reading `.env`/`*.pem`/`*.key`/`secrets/`, plus `rm -rf`, `git push`, and destructive `vercel` verbs (`deploy`, `--prod`, `promote`, `rollback`, `remove`, `env rm`, `domains`).
- `allow` — safe read-only commands (`git status/diff/log`, `npm run lint/test/build`, `tsc`, `vitest`, `vercel env pull/list/logs`).
- `ask` — `git commit`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge` (humans confirm).

## Self-tuning: measure → score → re-allocate

The kit measures itself and feeds the numbers back into routing, so model allocation gets closer to your real workload over time instead of staying at hand-picked defaults.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph RUN["Each /init-kit run"]
    direction TB
    OR["orchestrator routes"] --> SUB["subagents do the work"]
  end
  SUB -->|"SubagentStop hook<br/>metrics-subagent.sh"| EV["events.jsonl<br/>speed + tokens per model"]
  OR -->|"kit-record.sh<br/>route / escalation / review"| EV
  VER["verify.sh · Stop hook"] -->|"pass / fail"| EV
  EV -->|"/kit-stats"| SC["scorecard.json + .md<br/>fit score + cost per model"]
  SC -->|"/kit-tune --apply<br/>only if ≥ min_samples"| FM["agent frontmatter<br/>model tier promoted / demoted"]
  FM -->|"next run"| OR
  SC -.->|"read at start of run"| OR
```

### What is measured, and how honestly

Two halves, deliberately kept separate because they differ in how measurable they are:

| Signal | Source | Reliability |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Speed & token cost per model** | `SubagentStop` hook parses the session transcript (`isSidechain` turns → model, `usage`, timestamps) | Directly measured |
| **"Fit" per agent** | Pipeline **proxies** logged by the orchestrator: escalation to `deep-debugger`, review rounds, verify first-pass | Proxy — correlates with quality, not ground truth |

There is no automatic quality oracle, so "fit" is defined as objective pipeline outcomes. For v1: `fit_score = 1 − escalation_rate` (an agent that keeps needing escalation is under-powered for its tasks).

### The three commands / files

- **Telemetry** lands in `.claude/metrics/events.jsonl` (git-ignored). Written by the `SubagentStop` hook (speed/cost), `verify.sh` (pass/fail), and `kit-record.sh` (routing/escalation/review, called by the orchestrator).
- **`/kit-stats`** → aggregates events into `.claude/metrics/scorecard.{json,md}`: per-model p50/p95 duration + estimated cost, per-agent fit score, and pipeline health (verify first-pass rate, avg review rounds).
- **`/kit-tune`** → reads the scorecard and, **only past a sample threshold**, moves an agent along the ladder `haiku → sonnet → opus`. Dry-run by default; `--apply` edits the `model:` frontmatter line and logs the decision to `tuning-log.md`. The edit is a normal diff a human reviews before committing.

### Tuning thresholds

Configurable in `.claude/metrics/tuning.json` (defaults shown):

```json
{ "min_samples": 20, "promote_if_fit_below": 0.6, "enable_demote": false, "demote_if_fit_above": 0.97 }
```

An agent is **promoted** one tier when it has ≥ `min_samples` runs and its fit score falls below `promote_if_fit_below`. Demotion (to save cost on over-provisioned agents) is opt-in. Token prices for the cost estimate live in `.claude/metrics/pricing.json` — set your real per-model rates.

> **Honest limits:** the transcript format is internal and may change between Claude Code versions, so the parser is defensive and best-effort. Proxies correlate with quality but are not a substitute for it. Small samples are noisy — that is what `min_samples` guards against. Full auto-tune is scoped to a single reversible frontmatter edit, never anything destructive.

> Full metrics only ships with the **template** install (it carries `scripts/`). A plugin-only install still gets the `SubagentStop` speed/cost telemetry, but add the `scripts/` + commands to your project for the scorecard and auto-tune.

---

## Live status line — see which agents are running

The kit surfaces running agents in **two places**, because Claude Code exposes two separate status hooks:

**1. Agent panel rows — `subagentStatusLine`** (the authoritative one). Claude Code renders one row per active subagent below the prompt; the kit replaces the default `name · description · tokens` row with model tier, context usage, and status:

```
🤖 code-scout    haiku · 4% ctx   [running]
🤖 implementer   sonnet · 22% ctx [running]
🤖 code-reviewer opus · 6% ctx    [completed]
```

Claude Code passes a `tasks[]` array (id, name, model, `tokenCount`, `contextWindowSize`, status) on stdin once per refresh tick; the script (`scripts/subagent-statusline.sh`) prints one `{"id","content"}` line per row. This is the **only** status surface a plugin can ship, and the kit ships it in the plugin's `settings.json` — so it works for **both** plugin and template installs.

**2. Bottom bar — `statusLine`** (template only). A compact one-liner with model, dir, git branch, and a rollup of active agents:

```
▸ Opus  agentautokit  ⎇ main  🤖 code-scout · implementer×2
```

- Script: `scripts/statusline.sh`. It detects active agents by diffing `Task` tool-use ids against completed `tool_result` ids in the transcript, and reuses the same transcript the metrics hook reads.
- Set with `refreshInterval: 2` so it keeps updating **while a subagent runs** — the bottom bar is otherwise event-driven (it would only refresh when the main agent next speaks).
- Shows `·idle·` when nothing is delegating.

### Who can ship what

| Surface | Setting key | Plugin can ship? | Where the kit puts it |
|---------|-------------|:---:|-----------------------|
| Agent-panel rows | `subagentStatusLine` | ✅ yes | plugin `settings.json` + `template/.claude/settings.json` |
| Bottom bar | `statusLine` | ❌ no (project/user only) | `template/.claude/settings.json` |

Per the [plugin reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference), a plugin's `settings.json` only honours the `agent` and `subagentStatusLine` keys — `statusLine` must live in project or user settings. A plugin-only install therefore gets the agent-panel rows automatically; add the `statusLine` block to your `.claude/settings.json` if you also want the bottom-bar rollup:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/scripts/statusline.sh",
    "padding": 0,
    "refreshInterval": 2
  }
}
```

> Project settings override a user-level status line, so inside kit projects the bottom bar replaces your global one — edit or remove the block to keep yours. The bottom-bar active-agent rollup assumes the classic CLI transcript layout; it degrades to model + branch elsewhere, while the agent-panel rows use Claude Code's native `tasks[]` data and always work.

## Install & use

### A) As a repo template (recommended — carries permission rules)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slenderman2511/AgentAutoKit
./AgentAutoKit/scripts/init.sh /path/to/your/project
```

This copies `.claude/` (agents, commands, hooks, **settings.json with permission deny rules**) and a root `CLAUDE.md` into your project.

### B) As a Claude Code plugin (reusable agents/commands/hooks)

```
/plugin marketplace add slenderman2511/AgentAutoKit
/plugin install agent-auto-kit@agent-auto-kit-marketplace
```

Local test without installing:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./AgentAutoKit
claude plugin validate ./AgentAutoKit --strict
```

> **Important:** a plugin cannot ship permission rules (Claude Code only reads `agent`/`subagentStatusLine` from a plugin's settings). If you install via the plugin, add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json` manually:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)", "Read(./.env.*)", "Read(./**/*.pem)", "Read(./**/*.key)", "Read(./**/secrets/**)",
      "Bash(rm -rf:*)", "Bash(git push:*)",
      "Bash(vercel deploy:*)", "Bash(vercel --prod:*)", "Bash(vercel promote:*)",
      "Bash(vercel rollback:*)", "Bash(vercel remove:*)", "Bash(vercel env rm:*)", "Bash(vercel domains:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Then, in any installed project

```
/init-kit "add rate limiting to the login endpoint"
```

---

## Customizing

- Swap model aliases in agent frontmatter (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) or pin IDs (`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).
- Edit `hooks/protect-files.sh` to adjust protected paths.
- Tighten/loosen `template/.claude/settings.json` permissions per project.
